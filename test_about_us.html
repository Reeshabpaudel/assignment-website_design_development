                <p>This web-site is in its form as a result of college assignment. The idea for a travel management system actually came to me when I was travelling in a bus myself and found the experience rather uncomfortable. It sat back in my head for quite a while until I had to design a website as part of college assessment. Though the underlying backend and technical developments are still a far shot, hopefully this will be a part of a practicle problem solving piece of technology.</p>
